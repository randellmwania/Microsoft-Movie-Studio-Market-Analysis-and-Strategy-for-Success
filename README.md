## Project Overview.For this project, I will use exploratory data analysis to generate insights for a business stakeholder.

Business Problem

Microsoft is taking notice of major corporations producing their own unique video content and aims to join the excitement. 
With limited knowledge in the realm of filmmaking, 
Microsoft has made the decision to establish a fresh movie studio. Our responsibility is to delve into the current trends of successful films in terms of box office performance. 
We will then transform these discoveries into practical recommendations for the head of Microsoft's newly established movie studio, aiding them in determining the most suitable genres for their film projects.

# Conclusion
The number of movies has dropped significantly over the years.
The recommendations below align with Microsoft's goal of establishing a strong presence in the entertainment industry and maximizing the success of its movie ventures. 
By focusing on high-rated movies, expanding international distribution, and optimizing movie runtimes, Microsoft can enhance its competitive position and increase the likelihood of achieving positive business outcomes in the film industry.

As Microsoft lacks prior involvement in the movie industry and does not possess any existing movie intellectual property, they need to acquire IP from other studios. 
The selection of studios for Microsoft to purchase IP from will depend on their budgetary constraints.
# Recommendations

Based on the exploratory analysis of the provided data, here are three concrete business recommendations for Microsoft:

Invest in high-rated movies:
 
The analysis revealed a positive correlation between movie ratings and box office success. Microsoft should focus on producing and acquiring movies with higher average ratings. 
This can be achieved by investing in talented filmmakers, compelling scripts, and quality production to ensure the movies resonate well with the audience. By prioritizing high-rated movies, Microsoft can increase its chances of achieving better box office performance and profitability.

Expand international distribution: 

The analysis showed that foreign gross has a significant impact on the overall box office success of movies. Microsoft should consider expanding its international distribution efforts to capitalize on the global market. 
This can involve strategic partnerships with international distributors, localization of content to cater to specific regions, and targeted marketing campaigns to reach a wider audience. 
By tapping into international markets, Microsoft can maximize its revenue potential and global presence.

Optimize movie runtime: 

The analysis revealed that the average runtime of movies has been decreasing over the years. 
Microsoft should carefully consider the optimal runtime of their movies based on audience preferences and market trends. 
While shorter runtimes may cater to modern viewers' shorter attention spans, it's important to strike a balance between engaging storytelling and meeting audience expectations. 
By optimizing movie runtimes, Microsoft can deliver more captivating and well-paced movies that have a higher chance of resonating with the audience.
