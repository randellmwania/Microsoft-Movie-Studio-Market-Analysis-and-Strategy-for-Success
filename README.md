## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to analyze the factors contributing to the success of movies at the box office and provide actionable insights for Microsoft's newly established movie studio. Microsoft intends to enter the film industry but lacks expertise in movie production. Therefore, understanding the current trends and successful strategies in the movie industry is crucial for making informed decisions and determining the most suitable genres for their film projects.

## Business Problem

With the rise of major corporations producing their own unique video content, Microsoft recognizes the opportunity to establish its own movie studio. However, lacking knowledge in the realm of filmmaking, Microsoft needs to gain insights into the types of films that are currently performing well at the box office. The objective is to analyze market trends and identify key factors contributing to movie success, ultimately guiding Microsoft in developing a successful strategy for their entry into the movie industry.

## Data Description

The project utilizes datasets from various sources, including Box Office Mojo, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, TheMovieDB, and The Numbers. The datasets provide information on IMDB ratings, gross revenues, production budgets, release dates, and other relevant metrics for movies in the United States and international markets.

The specific datasets used in the analysis are as follows:

- `im.db` (in `im.zip`): The IMDB dataset contains IMDB ratings for movies in the United States.
- `bom.movie_gross.csv`: The Box Office Mojo dataset contains gross revenues for movies in the United States and foreign markets.
- `tmdb.movies.csv`: The dataset provides information on domestic and international gross profits of movies, as well as the production studio name and release year.
- `tn.movie_budgets.csv`: The Numbers dataset contains data on production budgets, release dates, domestic gross, and worldwide gross of movies.

## Analysis and Recommendations

Through exploratory data analysis, this project aims to identify market trends and key factors influencing box office success. The analysis provides actionable insights and recommendations for Microsoft's movie studio strategy. The following recommendations are based on the findings:

1. **Invest in high-rated movies:** The analysis reveals a positive correlation between movie ratings and box office success. Microsoft should prioritize producing and acquiring movies with higher average ratings. This can be achieved by investing in talented filmmakers, compelling scripts, and quality production to ensure audience appeal.
