## Project Overview

This project conducts a comprehensive market analysis to guide Microsoft's entry into the film industry through its newly established movie studio. By analyzing box office trends and success factors, we aim to provide actionable insights for Microsoft's decision-making in film production.

## Business Problem

Microsoft, recognizing the trend of major corporations producing unique video content, aims to establish its presence in the movie industry. However, lacking expertise in filmmaking, Microsoft needs to understand the types of films currently performing well at the box office to inform their production strategy.

## Data Description

The analysis utilizes datasets from various sources:

- IMDB (`im.db` in `im.zip`): Contains IMDB ratings for US movies
- Box Office Mojo (`bom.movie_gross.csv`): Provides gross revenues for US and foreign markets
- TheMovieDB (`tmdb.movies.csv`): Offers data on domestic and international gross profits, production studios, and release years
- The Numbers (`tn.movie_budgets.csv`): Contains information on production budgets, release dates, and worldwide gross

## Getting Started

To run this project:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required dependencies: `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn`
3. Run the Jupyter notebook: `jupyter notebook Microsoft-Movie-Studio-Market-Analysis-and-Strategy-for-Success.ipynb`

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.10.11
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SQLite3

## Analysis and Findings

Our analysis revealed:

- A positive correlation between movie ratings and box office success
- Significant impact of foreign gross on overall box office performance
- A trend of decreasing average movie runtimes over the years
- [Add other key findings from your analysis]

## Recommendations

Based on our analysis, we recommend Microsoft to:

1. Invest in high-rated movies by focusing on quality scripts and production
2. Expand international distribution to capitalize on foreign markets
3. Optimize movie runtimes to align with current trends and audience preferences
4. [Add any other key recommendations from your analysis]
